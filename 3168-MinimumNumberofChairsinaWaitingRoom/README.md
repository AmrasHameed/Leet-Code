You are given a string s. Simulate events at each second i:


	If s[i] == 'E', a person enters the waiting room and takes one of the chairs in it.
	If s[i] == 'L', a person leaves the waiting room, freeing up a chair.


Return the minimum number of chairs needed so that a chair is available for every person who enters the waiting room given that it is initially empty.

Example 2:


Input: s = "ELELEEL"
